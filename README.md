### Funding Requests Management System

#### Introduction
Several organizations, such as national lotteries and large companies, contribute to society by funding various initiatives and individuals. These funding opportunities can range from small event sponsorships to substantial grants for long-term projects like bursaries and research funds. Some funding initiatives also offer direct benefits to organizations, such as marketing exposure or exclusive rights.

#### Objectives
The project will be developed using Agile methodology, incorporating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles, and following a test-driven approach. The objective is to design, develop, and operationalize a publicly available, web-based application that fulfills the following requirements:

#### Overview of Features
- **Funding Opportunities Ads:** Enable organizations to advertise funding opportunities.
- **Applications:** Allow users to submit applications for funding opportunities.
- **Funding Review:** Enable fund managers to review and approve/reject applications.
- **Budgeting:** Provide tools for fund managers to manage the available funds.
- **Reporting:** Generate and display various reports on a dashboard, including funds usage over time and application data.
- **User Verification:** Implement user verification through a third-party identity provider with three roles: Applicants, Fund Managers, and Platform Admin.
- **User Management:** Allow admins to manage users, review and approve fund managers, block users, manage access, change permissions, etc.
- **Notifications:** Send relevant users notifications on updates to their applications.
- **Bonus:** Allow users to upload documents and scan them to pre-populate forms.
