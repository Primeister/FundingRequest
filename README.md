Funding Requests Management System

## Introduction
Several organizations, such as national lotteries and large companies, contribute to society by funding various initiatives and individuals. These funding opportunities can range from small event sponsorships to substantial grants for long-term projects like bursaries and research funds. Some funding initiatives also offer direct benefits to organizations, such as marketing exposure or exclusive rights. 

The goal of this project is to provide organizations with a centralized platform to advertise funding opportunities and manage incoming applications efficiently. The system will cater to three main types of funding opportunities: Educational (bursaries and scholarships), Business, and Events.

## Objectives
The project will be developed using Agile methodology, incorporating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles, and following a test-driven approach. The objective is to design, develop, and operationalize a publicly available, web-based application that fulfills the following requirements.
